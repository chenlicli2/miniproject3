we	ary	with	toil	i	haste	me	to	my	bed

how	can	i	then	re	turn	in	hap	py	plight
that	am	de	barred	the	ben	e	fit	of	rest
when	days	op	pres	sion	is	not	eased	by	night

when	in	dis	grace	with	for	tune	and	mens	eyes

from	sul	len	earth	sings	hymns	at	heav	ens	gate
for	thy	sweet	love	re	mem	bered	such	wealth	brings
that	then	i	scorn	to	change	my	state	with	kings


when	to	the	ses	sions	of	sweet	si	lent	thought
i	sum	mon	up	re	mem	brance	of	things	past
i	sigh	the	lack	of	many	a	thing	i	sought
and	with	old	woes	new	wail	my	dear	times	waste
then	can	i	drown	an	eye	un	used	to	flow

and	weep	af	resh	loves	long	since	can	celled	woe

then	can	i	grieve	at	gri	e	vances	fore	gone
and	heav	i	ly	from	woe	to	woe	tell	oer
the	sad	ac	count	of	fore	-	be	moaned	moan
which	i	new	pay	as	if	not	paid	be	fore
but	if	the	while	i	think	on	thee	dear	friend
all	loss	es	are	re	stored	and	sor	rows	end


thy	bo	som	is	en	de	ared	with	all	hearts

a	gainst	that	time	if	e	ver	that	time	come

when	as	thy	love	hath	cast	his	ut	most	sum

to	guard	the	law	ful	rea	sons	on	thy	part
to	leave	poor	me	thou	hast	the	strength	of	laws
since	why	to	love	i	can	al	lege	no	cause


how	he	avy	do	i	jour	ney	on	the	way
when	what	i	seek	my	we	ary	trav	els	end
doth	teach	that	case	and	that	re	pose	to	say
thus	far	the	miles	are	mea	sured	from	thy	friend
the	beast	that	bears	me	ti	red	with	my	woe
plods	dul	ly	on	to	bear	that	weight	in	me
as	if	by	some	in	stinct	the	wretch	did	know

which	heav	i	ly	he	an	swers	with	a	groan

for	that	same	groan	doth	put	this	in	my	mind
my	grief	lies	on	ward	and	my	joy	be	hind


thus	can	my	love	ex	cuse	the	slow	of	fence
of	my	dull	bear	er	when	from	thee	i	speed
from	where	thou	art	why	should	i	haste	me	thence

o	what	ex	cuse	will	my	poor	beast	then	find
when	swift	ex	trem	i	ty	can	seem	but	slow
then	should	i	spur	though	mount	ed	on	the	wind
in	win	ged	speed	no	mo	tion	shall	i	know
then	can	no	horse	with	my	de	sire	keep	pace
there	fore	de	sire	of	per	fectst	love	being	made
shall	neigh	no	dull	flesh	in	his	fi	ery	race

since	from	thee	go	ing	he	went	wil	ful-s	low

so	am	i	as	the	rich	whose	bles	sed	key

the	which	he	will	not	ev	ery	hour	sur	vey
